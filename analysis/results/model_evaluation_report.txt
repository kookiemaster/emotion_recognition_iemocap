Analysis of Overfitting:
----------------------

Average Overfitting Ratio: 0.9998

The models do not show significant signs of overfitting based on accuracy metrics alone.

However, the extremely high accuracy (near 100%) across all models suggests other issues:

1. The task may be too simple or deterministic (e.g., rule-based mapping from VAD to emotions)
2. There may be data leakage between training and testing sets
3. The evaluation methodology may not be robust (e.g., using the same data for training and evaluation)
4. The features (VAD values) may perfectly separate the emotion classes by design

Recommendations:
--------------

1. Implement proper cross-validation with stratified sampling
2. Use a separate holdout test set that is never seen during training
3. Investigate the relationship between VAD values and emotion labels to understand if the mapping is deterministic
4. If using text modality, ensure actual text data is used rather than placeholders
5. Consider more challenging evaluation scenarios, such as cross-dataset evaluation
